## Hi, I'm Ryan 👋

I’m a Software Engineer who enjoys building secure, scalable applications and solving complex integration challenges. My background is rooted in the .NET ecosystem, with extensive experience in the e-commerce and marketplace space.

### Technical Experience

* **Backend & Cloud:** Extensive work with C#, .NET Core, and ASP.NET Core. I’ve implemented distributed systems using Kafka and AWS SQS to handle high-volume order streaming and price changes.
* **Frontend:** I have a strong interest in building clean, intuitive user interfaces. While I work heavily in Angular and TypeScript, I enjoy the process of creating pixel-perfect implementations from the ground up.
* **Infrastructure:** Hands-on with Docker, Kubernetes (EKS/Helm), and Terraform to manage containerized environments and infrastructure-as-code.

### Current Interests

* **AI & Agentic Dev:** Experimenting with autonomous agents and LLM-assisted coding workflows.
